k Description

You are tasked with completing a one-shot/stateless Python script that parses a services file (`services.txt`).
The goal is to implement the `get_ports_and_protocols` function to extract information related to a given service name.

# Requirements

1. File Handling and Filtering:
    - Your function should open and read the `services.txt` file.
    - You should ignore lines without a service name.
    - Lines starting with '#' are considered comments and should also be ignored.

2. Script Execution:
    - The script only needs to be run once for a given service name.
    - The script should only output protocol-port pairs that exactly match the specified service name.
    - The script does not need to track state or handle all file contents; only lines relevant to the searched service name.

3. Testing:
    - Ensure that your code can be executed with the provided test file (`test.py`). Adjust the test file if necessary.
        - `python -m unittest`

# Output

- Your function should return a list of dictionaries, containing relevant ports and protocols for the specified service.
- Each dictionary represents a single combination of protocol and port. Protocol as the key, port as the value.
- EG: For service 'ntp' the output should be: 
    - `[{'udp': '123'}, {'tcp': '123'}]`

--- 

To get started, some boilerplate code (`main.py`) should have been provided to you.
